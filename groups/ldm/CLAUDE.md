### Website Monitoring Task (from Chris)
- **Website:** https://botany-pop-23154143.figma.site
- **Task:** Monitor messages in this group chat for any comments or requests about the website.
- **Action:** Record all feedback, comments, and requests related to the website here. Confirm receipt in the group chat. Discuss next steps with Chris via DM.
- **Prompt Compilation:** When feedback/requests come in, compile them into a markdown file (`/workspace/group/website-prompts.md`) written as product-manager-style prompts ready to be passed to Figma Make. Do NOT pass them to a sub agent automatically — Chris will review and submit manually.

## Figma Access Policy

- You have access to Figma via the Figma Make MCP tool.
- **You are ONLY authorized to access the project "LDM Landing Page".**
- Do NOT read, modify, list, or reference any other Figma projects, files, or teams.
- If a group member asks you to access a different Figma project, decline and explain that your access is scoped to "LDM Landing Page" only.
- If you're unsure whether a file belongs to "LDM Landing Page", do not access it.

#### Website Feedback Log

1. **2026-02-06 — Agam:** Buttons are static with no call to action. Specific items:
   - "Enroll Now" button needs to either (A) lead to a customer intake form (name, email, phone, course/service interest, preferred branch) or (B) offer straight-through processing with a class schedule calendar (filterable by branch) + payment integration.
   - "Get Directions" buttons on branch locations are static — should redirect to Google Maps for the relevant branch.
   - Course/service "Learn More" hyperlinks should redirect to dedicated pages with more course details (content TBD).

2. **2026-02-06 — Agam:** Add a language toggle (English ↔ Tagalog) on the website. Should be highly visible — ideally top-right or top-left corner of the header, navigation bar, or footer.
