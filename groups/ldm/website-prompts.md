## Prompt 1: Make "Enroll Now" Button Functional

**Source:** Agam (2026-02-06)

**Current state:** The "Enroll Now" button is static and does not perform any action when clicked.

**Requested change:** Make the "Enroll Now" button actionable. Two possible approaches (to be decided):

- **Option A — Customer Intake Form:** Clicking "Enroll Now" opens/redirects to a form that captures:
  - Full name
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - Course or service of interest
  - Preferred branch location

- **Option B — Straight-Through Processing:** Clicking "Enroll Now" opens a calendar view of available class schedules, filterable by branch location, with integrated payment processing for direct enrollment.

## Prompt 2: Make "Get Directions" Buttons Link to Google Maps

**Source:** Agam (2026-02-06)

**Current state:** The "Get Directions" buttons on branch location cards are static and non-functional.

**Requested change:** Each "Get Directions" button should redirect the user to Google Maps with the corresponding branch address pre-populated (e.g., via a `https://maps.google.com/?q=...` link).

## Prompt 3: Add Dedicated Course/Service Detail Pages

**Source:** Agam (2026-02-06)

**Current state:** Each course/service card has a "Learn More" hyperlink, but it does not navigate anywhere.

**Requested change:** Each "Learn More" link should redirect to a new dedicated page for that specific course or service, containing detailed information (course description, schedule, pricing, prerequisites, etc.). *Note: Specific course content to follow.*

## Prompt 4: Add Language Toggle (English / Tagalog)

**Source:** Agam (2026-02-06)

**Current state:** The website is only available in English with no option to switch languages.

**Requested change:** Add a language toggle that allows users to switch between **English** and **Tagalog**. The toggle should be:
- Highly visible and easy to find
- Placed in the **header/navigation bar area** (top-right corner recommended — this is the most common and intuitive placement for language selectors, keeping it accessible without interfering with primary navigation)
- Persistent across all pages
