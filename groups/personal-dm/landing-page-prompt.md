## Domain Candidates

### Likely Available (no DNS response / no active site)
These returned no response, suggesting they're either unregistered or parked without a site. **Verify on a registrar before buying.**

| Domain | Why It Works |
|--------|-------------|
| **botup.ai** | Short, punchy, verb-forward. "Bot up your business." |
| **trybot.ai** | Low-friction CTA built into the name. |
| **spawnbot.ai** | Technical, memorable, gamer-adjacent energy. |
| **1bot.ai** | Ultra-short, "one bot" = simplicity message. |
| **letbot.ai** | Conversational: "Let bot handle it." |
| **zapbot.ai** | Fast, electric energy. Like Zapier for bots. |
| **mintbot.ai** | Fresh, clean. Crypto-adjacent if that matters. |
| **forgebot.ai** | Craft/build metaphor. Strong brand. |
| **summonbot.ai** | Magical, powerful. "Summon your bot." |
| **botfor.me** | Personal, direct. "A bot for me." |
| **wantabot.com** | Playful, consumer-facing. Low barrier. |
| **deploy.bot** | Exact match for the CTA. .bot TLD is memorable. |
| **launch.bot** | Clean, action-oriented. |
| **run.bot** | Minimal, verb-only. |
| **build.bot** | Developer-friendly, clear. |
| **botlab.ai** | Science/innovation vibe. |

### Top 3 Picks (my ranking)
1. **deploy.bot** — Literally the CTA. Memorable, on-brand, unique TLD.
2. **1bot.ai** — Ultra-short, implies simplicity, .ai signals tech.
3. **spawnbot.ai** — Technical but fun, stands out, great for dev audience.

### Already Taken (for reference)

## Landing Page Design Prompt

### For Figma Make / AI Design Tool:

---

**Create a single-page landing page with a dark theme (near-black background #0a0a0a) and high-contrast accents. The style should feel like ai.com meets Vercel — minimal, premium, developer-friendly.**

### Layout (top to bottom):

**1. Nav Bar**
- Logo (text-only logotype, "butler-bot" in monospace/sans-serif, white)
- Right side: "Docs" "Pricing" "Login" links (gray text)
- Subtle bottom border (dark gray line)

**2. Hero Section (centered, above the fold)**
- Eyebrow tag: Small pill badge → "BETA" or "EARLY ACCESS" in accent color (electric blue #3b82f6 or green #10b981)
- Headline (large, bold, white):
  > **Your AI butler, deployed in 60 seconds.**
- Subheadline (medium, gray #9ca3af):
  > Choose a name. Pick a template. Hit deploy. Your personal AI bot goes live — no code, no infra, no waiting.
- **Deploy CTA Section:**
  - Input field with placeholder: `yourname.butler-bot.com`   - Large button next to it: **"Deploy →"** (accent color background, white text)
  - Below the input: small gray text → "Free during beta. No credit card required."

**3. Social Proof Bar**
- Horizontal row of small logos or text:
  > "Trusted by 200+ builders in beta" (or similar placeholder)
- Or: "Built on Claude · Powered by WhatsApp · Deployed on Edge"

**4. How It Works (3 columns)**
- Column 1: 🌐 **Choose Your Domain** → "Pick a memorable .bot domain for your AI agent."
- Column 2: ⚡ **Configure Your Bot** → "Select a template or describe what you need. Our AI handles the rest."
- Column 3: 🚀 **Hit Deploy** → "Your bot goes live instantly. Manage it from WhatsApp or web."

**5. Deploy Status Preview (key feature section)**
- Show a mockup/card of what the user sees after clicking Deploy:
  - Card with dark bg, rounded corners
  - Domain: `yourname.butler-bot.com`
  - Status: "🟡 Queued for deployment..."
  - Progress bar (animated, ~30%)
  - Estimated time: "~2 minutes"
  - Below: "We'll notify you when it's live."
- This is the market test element — people see a "deploying" state that shows demand without needing a real backend yet.

**6. Use Cases Section (optional, 2-3 cards)**
- "Customer Support Bot" — Handle FAQs and tickets 24/7
- "Sales Assistant" — Qualify leads and book meetings automatically
- "Personal Assistant" — Manage your calendar, email, and tasks via chat

**7. CTA Repeat (centered)**
- Headline: "Ready to deploy?"
- Same input + deploy button from hero
- Below: "Join 200+ builders already in the queue."

**8. Footer**
- Logo, copyright, links: Privacy · Terms · Twitter · Discord
- Built with ❤️ by [your brand]

### Design Specs:
- **Font:** Inter or Geist Sans (body), Geist Mono (code/domain input)
- **Colors:**
  - Background: #0a0a0a
  - Text primary: #ffffff
  - Text secondary: #9ca3af
  - Accent: #3b82f6 (blue) or #10b981 (green)
  - Cards/sections: #111111 with subtle border #1f1f1f
- **Spacing:** Generous whitespace, 80-120px section padding
- **Animations:** Subtle fade-in on scroll, pulsing dot on deploy status
