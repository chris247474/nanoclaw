## Core Thesis

Bitcoin follows a ~4-year cycle driven by halving events. The 20-Week Simple Moving Average (20W SMA) is the primary trend signal — used by macro traders as the "MoneyLine" (Ivan's yellow line). When price is above the 20W SMA, trend is bullish. When price falls below, trend flips bearish.

## Historical Halving Cycles

| Halving | Reward Change | Months to Top | Top Price | Months to Bottom | Drawdown | Halving Price | Top Multiple |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Nov '12 | 50 → 25 | 12 | $1,177 | 26 | 87.1% | $12.50 | 94x |
| Jul '16 | 25 → 12.5 | 17 | $19,783 | 29 | 84.2% | $650 | 30x |
| May '20 | 12.5 → 6.25 | 18 | $69,000 | 30 | 77.6% | $8,600 | 8x |
| Apr '24 | 6.25 → 3.125 | ~18 (proj) | ~$126K (proj) | TBD | TBD | $63,900 | ~2x |

**Pattern:** Diminishing returns each cycle. Top multiples: 94x → 30x → 8x → ~2x. Drawdowns: 87% → 84% → 78% → projected ~70-75%.

## Key Signals

### Trend Signals
- **Bullish:** Weekly close ABOVE 20W SMA → "Price crosses above 20W SMA"
- **Bearish:** Weekly close BELOW 20W SMA → "Price crosses below 20W SMA"

### Top Signals
- **MVRV peak decay + F&G > 90** (Fear & Greed above 90 = extreme greed)
- **Pi Cycle fires (>=98% proximity)**

### Bottom Signals
- **MVRV < 0.1 + F&G < 10** (extreme fear)
- **Price at 200W MA** (historically the ultimate floor)
- **Price within 25% of 200WMA with F&G < 20**

### Accumulation Zone
- Price within 25% of 200WMA (~$58-62K) with F&G < 20
- Heavy accumulation at 200WMA touch (~$46-50K)
- Projected optimal window: Q3 '26 - Q2 '27

## Current Cycle Roadmap (Apr '24 Halving)

| Period | Months Post-Halving | Phase | Price Level | Status |
|--------|-------------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Feb-Apr '26 | 22-24 | Distribution / Decline | $58K-$72K | **← YOU ARE HERE** |
| May-Jul '26 | 25-27 | Bear Acceleration | $45K-$60K | |
| Aug-Dec '26 | 28-32 | Capitulation → Bottom | $35K-$50K | |
| Jan-Jun '27 | 33-38 | Accumulation (BUY ZONE) | $40K-$55K | |
| Jul-Dec '27 | 39-44 | Recovery → 20WMA Flip | $55K-$82K | |
| ~Mar '28 | 48 | HALVING → 1.5625 BTC | ~$100K | |
| Apr-Dec '28 | 49-56 | Post-Halving Bull | $105K-$175K | |
| Q1-Q2 '29 | 57-66 | Blow-off → NEXT ATH | $180K-$220K | |

## Primary Scenario (Base Case)

Decline to $55-62K Q1-Q2 '26. Bottom $35-50K Q3-Q4 '26. Accumulate for 2028 halving → projected ~$220K top by Q2 '29.

### Key Projected Events
- **Bear bottom @ ~30 months** → Oct '26, ~$38-42K (200WMA break)
- **Next halving** → ~Mar '28
- **Projected cycle top** → Q1-Q2 '29, ~$200-220K

### Projected Price Path

| Feb '29 | $180,000 | $54,000 | $138,000 | |

## Alternative Scenario (ETF Floor / Mild Bear)

ETF floor holds, $67K near bottom. Needs $86K weekly close. No evidence yet.

## Key Actual Events (This Cycle)

| Date | Price | Event |
|------|-------|-------|
| Dec '22 | $15,476 | FTX bottom |
| Mar '24 | $73,800 | Pre-halving high |
| Apr '24 | $63,900 | HALVING |
| Dec '24 | $96,400 | Trump elected |
| Dec '25 | $94,500 | 20WMA bear flip |

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Track the 20W SMA** — It's the primary trend indicator. Bull above, bear below.
2. **Watch the 200W MA** — It's the cycle floor. Price touching it = max accumulation zone.
3. **Don't trade, accumulate** — The "No Trader" approach: use the cycle to DCA at optimal times.
4. **F&G + MVRV** — Confirm extremes. F&G < 20 = buy zone. F&G > 90 = distribution zone.
5. **Pi Cycle** — Fires near tops (>=98% proximity). Use as exit signal confirmation.
