INVESTMENT DUE DILIGENCE REPORT
Arandia Farm & Resort - Fire Sale Acquisition

TARGET: Arandia College / Yolanda's Integrated Farm & Resort
LOCATION: Magallanes, Cavite (3.3 hectares titled land)
ASKING PRICE: ₱30,000,000 (₱20M down, ₱10M on title transfer)
DEAL TYPE: Distressed asset - seller needs cash for debt
ANALYSIS DATE: February 9, 2026
ANALYST: Verch (PE Fund Due Diligence)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

⚠️ PROCEED WITH CAUTION - CONDITIONAL GREEN LIGHT

This is a LAND-VALUE ARBITRAGE PLAY with cash-flow optionality, not a pure operating business acquisition. The land alone is worth ₱81-146M (2.7x-4.9x purchase price), providing exceptional downside protection.

KEY VALUE DRIVERS:
✓ Acquiring land at ₱900/sqm vs ₱2,500-4,500/sqm market (67-80% discount)
✓ Operating business covers holding costs while positioning for exit
✓ Multiple exit strategies (land flip, business sale, agri-tourism development)

CRITICAL RISKS:
⚠️ HIGH: Financial normalization uncertainty - seller's numbers are unreliable
⚠️ HIGH: Political revenue dependency (22% from senatorial vouchers)
⚠️ HIGH: Permit transferability (TESDA accreditation, environmental)
⚠️ MEDIUM: Environmental compliance (piggery operations)

INVESTMENT THESIS: THE ASYMMETRIC BET

Scenario                          Value           Multiple    Probability
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Downside (land-only liquidation)  ₱81-97M (zonal)    2.7-3.2x    High
Base case (land + stabilized ops) ₱113-146M (market) 3.8-4.9x    Medium
Upside (agri-tourism development) ₱150M+             5.0x+       Low-Medium

💡 Risk-Adjusted Return: Even in distressed liquidation at zonal value, you're looking at 2.7x+ return. This is NOT a typical SME acquisition risk profile.

BOTTOM LINE RECOMMENDATION

🟢 INVESTMENT DECISION: PROCEED - TIER 2 PRIORITY

DEAL-MAKING FACTORS (PROS):
✓ Exceptional land value arbitrage (2.7-4.9x return on land alone)
✓ Downside protection (even worst case returns 2.7x)
✓ Multiple exit paths (land flip, business sale, agri-tourism, selldown)
✓ Seller distress suggests negotiating leverage
✓ Cash-flow optionality if business works

RISK FACTORS (CONS):
⚠️ Financial opacity - seller's numbers are unreliable
⚠️ Political revenue dependency (22% from senator's vouchers)
⚠️ Permit transferability uncertainty
⚠️ Environmental liability (piggery violations)
⚠️ Operational complexity (6-12 month stabilization)

NET ASSESSMENT:
This is a LAND PLAY WITH BUSINESS HEDGE, not a business acquisition. You're paying ₱30M for ₱81-146M of land. The operating business is free optionality - if it works, great (₱3-5M EBITDA). If it doesn't, you still have 2.7x+ return on land.

💰 EXPECTED RETURN (CONSERVATIVE):
• Exit Year 3 at ₱130M (land-led sale)
• Gross return: 3.9-4.3x on ₱30-33M all-in
• 3-year IRR: 60-75%

• 100-day plan: ₱1.9M
• Contingency: ₱2-3M (environmental, permits, staff)

🎯 FINAL VERDICT: PROCEED TO DD WITH ₱28M OFFER

This deal has exceptional risk-adjusted returns driven by land value arbitrage. 
The operating business is a bonus, not the thesis. Biggest risks are financial 
opacity and permit transferability, both mitigable through structured DD and 
deal terms. Recommend moving to LOI submission within 72 hours to test seller's 
distress level and negotiating posture.
