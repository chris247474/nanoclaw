# Investment Due Diligence Summary

**Target:** Cash-based retail/service business (₱21M annual sales)
**Analysis Date:** February 9, 2026
**Analyst:** Verch (PE Fund Due Diligence)

---

## Executive Summary

This is a **HARD PASS** or requires immediate forensic audit before any valuation discussion. The company shows deteriorating financial controls with **₱26.99M (47% of total sales) unaccounted for** across 2022-2024. 2024 shows catastrophic collapse in deposit discipline.

---

## Critical Red Flags

### 1. Fraud/Embezzlement Risk - CRITICAL

- **₱13.6M missing in 2024 alone** (64% of sales undeposited)
- Deposit ratio collapsed from 65% (2023) to 36% (2024) despite stable sales
- Every single month in 2024 showed under-deposits — systematic pattern, not random variance
- July 2024: ₱1.61M single-month gap (76% unaccounted)

**Assessment:** This pattern screams internal theft or systematic diversion of cash.

### 2. No Financial Controls

- No daily reconciliation evident
- No documented deposit proof/audit trail mentioned
- "Over-deposits" in some months (2023: Aug/Sep/Oct) suggest retroactive adjustments to hide shortfalls
- Sales data exists but cash doesn't reach the bank = zero accountability

### 3. Working Capital Black Hole

- ₱26.99M cumulative unexplained difference = **1.3x annual sales**
- If cash isn't stolen, where is it? COGS? Undisclosed expenses? Off-book operations?
- No inventory/AP/AR context provided to explain cash burn

### 4. Management Dysfunction

- 2024 shows no corrective action despite worsening trend
- Report prepared by "Maydeline del Rosario" (bookkeeper?) — no CFO/controller oversight evident
- Recommendations are basic hygiene (daily reconciliation, deposit slips) = these don't exist now

---

## Deal-Killer Questions

### 1. Where is the ₱26.99M?

- **If embezzled** → fraud liability, potential lawsuits, criminal exposure
- **If legitimate expenses** → EBITDA is fictitious, business is cash-flow negative
- **If tied up in inventory/AR** → working capital crisis

### 2. Why did 2024 collapse?

- Key employee quit/fired?
- Owner health issue reducing oversight?
- Business model change (credit sales not captured)?

### 3. Are sales figures real?

- If deposits don't match sales, who verified the sales data?
- Could be inflated top-line to mask declining business

### 4. What's the actual profitability?

- No P&L, no COGS, no expense breakdown
- Reported sales mean nothing if cash doesn't materialize

---

## Valuation Impact

**Current asking price:** TBD
**Adjusted value:** **₱0 until proven otherwise**

- Cannot value a business where 47% of revenue disappears
- Enterprise value = recoverable assets (inventory, equipment, customer base) minus fraud liabilities
- Likely worth only **liquidation value** unless audit clears the ₱26.99M

---

## Mitigation Strategy (If You Still Want This Deal)

### Immediate Actions (Pre-LOI)

#### 1. Forensic Audit
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Cost:** ₱200K-500K

**Scope:**
- Trace ₱26.99M: bank statements, personal accounts, inventory purchases, supplier payments
- Interview staff confidentially (someone knows where the cash went)
- Review POS data vs bank deposits by day

#### 2. Seller Representations & Warranties
- Personal guarantee from owner for undisclosed liabilities
- Holdback 50%+ of purchase price in escrow for 24 months
- Right to clawback if fraud discovered

#### 3. Staff Interviews
- Meet the cashiers, bookkeeper, anyone handling money
- Assess if this is known/tolerated vs management complicity

### Post-Acquisition Actions (If Deal Proceeds)

#### 1. Install Controls Day 1
- New POS system with real-time bank integration
- Daily manager reconciliation (sales vs deposits vs register count)
- Segregate duties: different people handle cash, record sales, make deposits

#### 2. Replace Entire Finance Function
- Bring in your own CFO/controller
- Assume current bookkeeper is compromised (complicit or incompetent)

#### 3. Customer Revenue Audit
- **If B2B:** verify receivables with customers
- **If retail:** install cameras on registers, mystery shoppers

## Financial Summary (2022-2024)

| Year | Total Sales | Total Deposited | Difference | Deposit Ratio |
|------|-------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| 2022 | ₱14,356,353 | ₱8,561,101 | ₱5,795,252 | 60% |
| 2023 | ₱21,813,012 | ₱14,188,953 | ₱7,624,059 | 65% |
| 2024 | ₱21,269,857 | ₱7,672,424 | ₱13,597,433 | 36% |
| **Total** | **₱57,439,222** | **₱30,422,478** | **₱26,999,744** | **53%** |

### Key Observations:
- Sales grew 48% from 2022 to 2023 (healthy growth)
- Sales flat in 2024 (-2.5% YoY)
- Deposits **collapsed 46%** in 2024 despite stable sales
- 2024 gap (₱13.6M) is **2.3x larger** than 2023 gap (₱7.6M)

## Bottom Line

### Do Not Proceed Without Full Explanation of the ₱26.99M

This isn't "weak controls" — this is a business where half the cash vanishes. You'd be buying a liability unless the owner can prove:

1. The missing cash went to legitimate business expenses (and show receipts), **OR**
2. They've already recovered the funds and prosecuted the fraudster, **OR**
3. They'll discount the purchase price by ₱26.99M + a fraud risk premium (50%+ haircut)

Even then, the infrastructure to allow this level of leakage means you're buying a **turnaround project**, not a performing asset.

### Investment Required for Professionalization:
- **Timeline:** 12-18 months
- **Cost:** ₱2-3M for systems, controls, and management team
- **Risk:** High execution risk given current state

### Opportunity Cost:
Time spent investigating this mess could be spent on cleaner deals with audited financials.

## Recommendation

**PASS** — unless seller provides:
- Complete forensic audit results (at their expense)
- Full explanation with supporting documentation for ₱26.99M
- 50%+ purchase price discount to compensate for fraud risk and turnaround effort

**Risk Rating:** ⚠️ **EXTREME**
**Priority:** Low (investigate only if no better alternatives)
