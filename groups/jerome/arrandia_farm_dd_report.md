# Investment Due Diligence Report
## Arandia Farm & Resort - Fire Sale Acquisition

**Target:** Arandia College / Yolanda's Integrated Farm & Resort
**Location:** Magallanes, Cavite (3.3 hectares titled land)
**Asking Price:** ₱30,000,000 (₱20M down, ₱10M on title transfer)
**Deal Type:** Distressed asset - seller needs cash for debt
**Analysis Date:** February 9, 2026
**Analyst:** Verch (PE Fund Due Diligence)

---

## Executive Summary

**PROCEED WITH CAUTION - CONDITIONAL GREEN LIGHT**

This is a **land-value arbitrage play** with cash-flow optionality, not a pure operating business acquisition. The land alone is worth ₱81-146M (2.7x-4.9x purchase price), providing exceptional downside protection. The operating business (TESDA training + livestock) generates estimated ₱3-4M EBITDA but comes with **significant financial opacity and execution risk**.

**Key value drivers:**
- Acquiring land at ₱900/sqm vs ₱2,500-4,500/sqm market (67-80% discount)
- Operating business covers holding costs while positioning for exit
- Multiple exit strategies (land flip, business sale, agri-tourism development)

**Critical risks:** Financial normalization uncertainty, permit transferability, environmental compliance (piggery), political revenue dependency (senatorial vouchers).

## Investment Thesis

### The Asymmetric Bet

| Scenario | Value | Multiple on ₱30M | Probability |
|----------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **Downside (land-only liquidation)** | ₱81-97M (zonal) | 2.7-3.2x | High |
| **Base case (land + stabilized ops)** | ₱113-146M (market) | 3.8-4.9x | Medium |
| **Upside (agri-tourism development)** | ₱150M+ | 5.0x+ | Low-Medium |

**Risk-adjusted return:** Even in a distressed liquidation scenario (land-only sale at zonal value), you're looking at 2.7x+ return. This is **not** a typical SME acquisition risk profile.

---

## Deal Structure Analysis

### Seller's Position
- **Motivation:** "Fire sale - needs cash for debt" (distressed, time pressure)
- **Terms:** ₱20M down, ₱10M deferred (33% holdback until title transfer)
- **Red flag:** Why deferred payment structure? Suggests title/documentation issues may exist

### Proposed Counter-Structure

**Phase 1: ₱20M down payment (contingent)**
- Release only after satisfying conditions precedent (see Section 10)
- Escrow structure recommended (₱15M to seller, ₱5M holdback for 90 days)

**Phase 2: ₱10M balance (upon clean title transfer)**
- Should include warranty clawback provisions (18-24 months)
- Deduct actual costs for permit re-application, environmental compliance

**Alternative structure:** Offer ₱25M all-cash immediate close with **no** contingencies vs ₱30M with full DD and warranties. Test seller's true distress level.

---

## Asset Valuation Breakdown

### Land Valuation

**Property specs:**
- 3.3 hectares (32,474 sqm) titled land
- 111m road frontage, cemented access
- Utilities: Meralco, municipal water, PLDT
- Classification: Agricultural (zonal shows CR/mixed-use potential)

**Comparable values (per sqm):**

| Valuation Method | Price/sqm | Total Value | vs. Ask Price |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| BIR Zonal Value | ₱2,500-3,000 | ₱81-97M | 2.7-3.2x |
| Market Estimate | ₱3,500-4,500 | ₱113-146M | 3.8-4.9x |
| **Entry Price** | **₱900-925** | **₱30M** | **Baseline** |

**Downside protection:** Land value alone covers purchase price by 2.7-4.9x. Even if business is worthless, this is a winning trade.

**Sanity check required:** Why is seller accepting 20-33% of land value?
1. **Possible:** True distress + lack of market knowledge + urgency
2. **Concerning:** Title defects, zoning restrictions, environmental liens, undisclosed easements

**Action:** Commission independent appraisal (₱50-100K cost, critical gate).

---

### Existing Structures & Improvements

**Included assets (seller-stated):**
- Farmhouse with trusses
- TESDA training facilities
- Piggery facilities + livestock pens
- Site development (gazebo, training buildings)

**Problem:** No depreciated book value or replacement cost provided. Seller may be inflating asset value to justify price (but price is already 70%+ below land value, so this is noise).

**Assumption:** Value structures at ₱3-5M salvage/replacement cost. Not material to investment thesis.

---

## Operating Business Assessment

### Revenue Sources (Seller-Provided, Normalized)

| Revenue Stream | Annual Estimate | % of Total | Dependency Risk |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| TESDA vouchers | ₱2.0M | 15% | Medium (institutional) |
| **Senatorial vouchers (Marcos)** | **₱2.8M** | **22%** | **HIGH - political** |
| Livestock (pigs, goats, piglets) | ₱7.7M | 59% | Low (market-based) |
| Crops (fruits, vegetables) | ₱0.45M | 4% | Low |
| **Total Reported** | **₱12.97M** | **100%** | |

**Critical issue:** Seller stated revenue is "cumulative over multiple cycles" then "normalized annually." This is financial double-speak. Which is it?

**Red flags:**
1. **Senatorial vouchers (₱2.8M / 22% of revenue)** - tied to Sen. Aimee Marcos. What happens post-acquisition? Is this personal relationship-dependent? Is the accreditation transferable or tied to current owner?
2. **Livestock revenue (₱7.7M)** - "mixed cycles" suggests this isn't annual revenue but multi-year batches. How many cycles per year? What's the cash conversion cycle?
3. **No audited financials** - seller clarified expenses cover "~3-year period." If expenses are 3-year cumulative (₱3.58M), then annualized opex is ₱1.2M, making the ₱12.97M revenue figure suspect.

### Expense Analysis (Seller-Provided, Requires Normalization)

| Expense Category | Stated Amount | Annual (Normalized) | % of Revenue |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Salaries & wages | ₱720,000 | ₱240,000 | 2% |
| Training costs | ₱810,000 | ₱270,000 | 2% |
| Feedstock | ₱1,080,000 | ₱360,000 | 3% |
| Food allowance | ₱424,000 | ₱141,000 | 1% |
| Fuel | ₱250,000 | ₱83,000 | 1% |
| Repairs & maintenance | ₱150,000 | ₱50,000 | 0.4% |
| Utilities | ₱90,000 | ₱30,000 | 0.2% |
| Telephone | ₱36,000 | ₱12,000 | 0.1% |
| Taxes & licenses | ₱20,000 | ₱7,000 | 0.05% |
| **Total (3-year stated)** | **₱3,580,000** | **₱1,193,000** | **9%** |

**If these numbers are real (big if):**
- Annualized expenses: ₱1.2M
- Reported revenue: ₱12.97M (but unclear if annual or cumulative)
- **Implied EBITDA: ₱11.8M (91% margin)** ← This is fantasy-land

**Buyer's normalized view: ₱3-4M EBITDA**

This suggests buyer assumes:
- Actual annual revenue: ₱4-5M (not ₱12.97M)
- Actual annual expenses: ₱1-2M (in the ballpark of seller's normalized figure)

**Verdict:** Seller's financials are **unreliable for valuation**. Do not underwrite based on these numbers.

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISKS (Deal Killers if Not Mitigated)

#### 1. Financial Opacity - HIGH
**Issue:** Revenue stated as "cumulative over multiple cycles" then "normalized annually." Expenses covering "~3-year period." No audited statements, no bank records, no tax returns provided.

**Why this matters:** You're buying ₱30M of land, not a business. But if you're paying ₱30M expecting ₱3-4M EBITDA to cover holding costs, and actual EBITDA is ₱0-1M (or negative), your IRR drops materially.

**Mitigation:**
- **Demand:** 3 years of bank statements (all accounts), BIR ITRs, audited financials (if any)
- **Verify:** TESDA voucher receipts (easy to confirm with TESDA directly)
- **Interrogate:** Sen. Marcos vouchers - get copies of contracts, confirm transferability
- **Walk the site:** Count livestock, inspect facilities, interview staff off-site
- **Financial forensics:** If seller refuses bank statements, walk away or discount price by ₱5-10M

**Contingency:** Structure deal with ₱5M holdback tied to achieving ₱3M EBITDA within first 12 months post-acquisition (earn-out). If seller is confident, they'll accept.

#### 2. Political Revenue Dependency - HIGH
**Issue:** ₱2.8M (22% of reported revenue) comes from senatorial vouchers tied to Sen. Aimee Marcos.

**Questions:**
- Is this a personal relationship between seller and senator?
- Is the accreditation institutional (tied to the facility) or personal (tied to the owner)?
- Will vouchers continue under new ownership?
- What's the political risk (senator loses next election, program gets defunded)?

**Mitigation:**
- **Confirm in writing** from TESDA and senator's office that accreditation is transferable
- **Discount base case** - assume zero senatorial voucher revenue (₱2.8M haircut to revenue)
- **Adjusted EBITDA assuming no political revenue:** ₱0.2-1.2M (still covers holding costs)

**Deal impact:** Even if you lose all political revenue, land value still justifies acquisition. But this kills the "cash-flow carry" narrative.

#### 3. Permit Transferability - MEDIUM-HIGH
**Issue:** Seller states permits "can be transferred or re-applied under new ownership; verification required." This is lawyer-speak for "I don't actually know."

**Critical permits:**
- TESDA accreditation (revenue-dependent)
- Dept. of Agriculture / ATI approval (nice-to-have)
- Mayor's Permit (required for operations)
- Building permits (required for structures)
- Environmental permits for piggery (legally required, may not exist)

**Mitigation:**
- **Legal audit:** Have counsel request certified copies of ALL permits, verify status, confirm transferability (budget ₱100-150K)
- **TESDA direct contact:** Call TESDA regional office, verify accreditation is facility-based, not owner-based
- **Contingency:** Include in SPA that seller is responsible for all permit transfer costs + penalties. If permits are non-transferable, buyer can walk or renegotiate price.

**Timeline risk:** Permit re-application in Philippines can take 6-18 months. Budget for zero revenue during this window.

#### 4. Environmental Compliance (Piggery) - MEDIUM-HIGH
**Issue:** Property operates a piggery. Piggeries in Philippines require:
- Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) from DENR
- Wastewater discharge permits
- Compliance with Clean Water Act, Ecological Solid Waste Management Act

**Likelihood seller has these:** Low (most small piggeries operate informally).

**Risk:**
- DENR shuts down piggery post-acquisition
- Neighboring properties file complaints (smell, water contamination)
- Fines + remediation costs (₱500K-2M)
- Reputational damage if positioning as eco-resort

**Mitigation:**
- **Phase 1 DD:** Request all environmental permits, inspect wastewater systems
- **If permits don't exist:** Discount price by ₱2-3M OR require seller to obtain ECC before closing
- **Walk the site:** Check for signs of water contamination, talk to neighbors about complaints
- **Exit plan:** Budget ₱1-2M for piggery decommissioning if environmental risk is unmanageable

**Upside:** If you shut down piggery and pivot to agri-tourism, you eliminate this risk entirely + improve land use.

---

### MEDIUM RISKS (Manageable, Require DD)

#### 5. Easement Rights - MEDIUM
**Issue:** Seller claims "adjacent easement" is "exclusive-use" but states "legal confirmation required."

**Why this matters:** If easement is shared or public, it affects:
- Site access during construction
- Future development plans (resort, agri-tourism)
- Resale value

**Mitigation:**
- **Title search:** Annotated on title? Registered easement agreement?
- **Survey:** Commission geodetic survey to map easement boundaries (₱50-80K)
- **Legal opinion:** If easement is disputed or unclear, discount land value by 10-15%

#### 6. Zoning Restrictions - MEDIUM
**Issue:** Land classified as "Agricultural" but BIR zonal classification shows "CR / mixed-use."

**Questions:**
- Can you legally operate a resort on agricultural land?
- Do you need zoning reclassification for commercial use?
- What's the cost and timeline for reclassification?

**Mitigation:**
- **Zoning cert:** Request from Municipal Planning & Development Office (free, 2-3 weeks)
- **If purely agricultural:** Factor ₱500K-1M for reclassification fees + 6-12 months timeline
- **Opportunity:** Agricultural land has lower property tax (0.5-1% vs 2% for commercial). If you don't need commercial use immediately, delay reclassification and save on taxes.

#### 7. Flood Risk - MEDIUM
**Issue:** Property adjacent to river. Seller claims "no flooding history."

**Validation needed:**
- Cavite PDRRMO flood hazard maps
- Site visit during rainy season (June-October)
- Interview neighbors

**If flood-prone:** Discount land value by 15-20%, affects resort/agri-tourism viability.

#### 8. Staffing Continuity - LOW-MEDIUM
**Issue:** Seller states "current manpower not guaranteed to transfer" and "no long-term employment contracts."

**Implication:** You're inheriting operations but not the team. Key risks:
- Loss of institutional knowledge (livestock cycles, training programs, local relationships)
- Rehiring costs + training time
- TESDA trainers may be personally certified (can they train under new entity?)

**Mitigation:**
- **Interview key staff** before closing (manager, TESDA trainers, livestock handlers)
- **Retention bonuses:** Offer 3-6 month retention packages to critical staff (budget ₱200-400K)
- **Transition support:** Require seller to stay on as consultant for 90 days (bake into SPA)

---

### LOW RISKS (Monitor, Not Deal Breakers)

#### 9. Title Defects - LOW (verify during DD)
Seller provided "Certified Title Certificate (CTC/TCT)." Standard title verification will catch liens, encumbrances, tax delinquencies.

#### 10. Utilities - LOW
Meralco, municipal water, PLDT all connected. Low risk of service interruption.

#### 11. Access - LOW
Cemented road access with 111m frontage. Excellent for future development.

## Valuation & Deal Structuring

### Purchase Price Justification

| Component | Conservative Value | Optimistic Value |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Land (zonal value) | ₱81,000,000 | ₱97,000,000 |
| Land (market value) | ₱113,000,000 | ₱146,000,000 |
| Structures & improvements | ₱3,000,000 | ₱5,000,000 |
| Operating business (5x EBITDA) | ₱15,000,000 | ₱20,000,000 |
| **Total Enterprise Value** | **₱99-116M** | **₱148-168M** |
| **Asking Price** | **₱30,000,000** | **₱30,000,000** |
| **Discount to value** | **74-85%** | **82-88%** |

**Conclusion:** At ₱30M, you're paying for 37% of land's zonal value and getting:
- The other 63% of land value (₱51M+) for free
- Operating business (₱15-20M) for free
- Structures (₱3-5M) for free

**This is why the deal looks too good to be true.** Verify the "catch."

---

### Recommended Offer Structure

**Option A: Conservative (Risk-Averse)**

**Offer:** ₱28,000,000 structured as:
- ₱15M on signing (subject to DD)
- ₱8M on clean title transfer + permit confirmation
- ₱5M holdback (escrow for 18 months) for warranty claims

**Conditions precedent:**
1. Clean title verification (no liens, encumbrances, tax delinquencies)
2. Zoning confirmation (mixed-use or path to reclassification)
3. Environmental compliance audit passes OR seller remediates at own cost
4. TESDA confirms accreditation is transferable
5. Easement rights legally confirmed
6. Seller provides 3 years of bank statements + ITRs

**Walk-away triggers:**
- Title defects exceeding ₱2M to cure
- Environmental violations requiring shutdown
- TESDA accreditation non-transferable + no senatorial vouchers (kills 37% of revenue)

**Option B: Aggressive (Higher Risk, Higher Return)**

**Offer:** ₱25,000,000 all-cash, 30-day close, **minimal DD**

**Rationale:** If seller is truly distressed, they'll take ₱5M haircut for certainty and speed. You're still buying land at ₱770/sqm (70%+ discount).

**Risk:** You inherit all title, environmental, and permit issues. Budget ₱3-5M post-closing to resolve.

**When to use:** If DD reveals seller is hiding something and won't provide docs. You're betting land value covers all risks.

**Option C: Hybrid (Balanced)**

**Offer:** ₱30,000,000 as proposed BUT:
- ₱18M on signing
- ₱7M on title transfer + permit confirmation
- ₱5M earn-out (paid if business achieves ₱3M EBITDA within 12 months)

**Rationale:** Align seller incentives. If they're confident about financials, they'll accept. If they balk, you know revenue is overstated.

## Recommendation

### Investment Decision: **PROCEED - TIER 2 PRIORITY**

**Rationale:**

**Pros (Deal-Making):**
1. **Exceptional land value arbitrage** - 2.7-4.9x implied return on land alone
2. **Downside protection** - Even worst case (liquidation at zonal value) returns 2.7x
3. **Multiple exit paths** - Land flip, business sale, agri-tourism, partial selldown
4. **Seller distress** - "Fire sale for debt" suggests negotiating leverage
5. **Cash-flow optionality** - If business works, covers holding costs + generates returns

**Cons (Risk Factors):**
1. **Financial opacity** - Seller's numbers are unreliable, high normalization risk
2. **Political revenue dependency** - 22% of revenue tied to senator's vouchers
3. **Permit transferability** - Uncertainty on TESDA accreditation + environmental compliance
4. **Environmental liability** - Piggery may have violations, ₱1-2M remediation cost
5. **Operational complexity** - Inheriting business without team, 6-12 month stabilization

**Net Assessment:**

This is a **land play with a business hedge**, not a business acquisition. You're paying ₱30M for ₱81-146M of land. The operating business is free optionality - if it works, great (₱3-5M EBITDA). If it doesn't, you still have a 2.7x+ return on land.

**Key decision factors:**
- **If you're focused on capital preservation + land value:** Strong buy at ₱25-28M
- **If you're focused on cash-flowing business:** Higher risk, requires 6-12 months stabilization, unclear if ₱3-4M EBITDA is real
- **If you're focused on IRR:** 50-70% 3-year IRR achievable with competent execution

### Recommended Deal Terms

**Offer:** ₱28,000,000
- ₱15M on signing (post-DD approval)
- ₱8M on clean title transfer + TESDA accreditation confirmation
- ₱5M holdback (18-month escrow) for warranty claims

**Conditions precedent:**
1. Clean title + zoning confirmation
2. TESDA accreditation verified as transferable
3. Environmental audit passes OR seller remediates at cost
4. Seller provides 3 years bank statements + ITRs
5. Easement rights legally confirmed

**Walk-away triggers:**
- Title defects >₱2M to cure
- Independent appraisal <₱60M
- TESDA non-transferable + zero senatorial vouchers (loses 37% of revenue)

**Negotiating leverage:**
- Seller is distressed ("fire sale for debt")
- Seller has financial opacity (can't prove claimed EBITDA)
- Buyer has other deals in pipeline (opportunity cost)

**Budget for post-acquisition:**
- ₱1.9M (100-day plan)
- ₱2-3M (contingency for environmental, permits, staff)
- **Total:** ₱4-5M on top of ₱28M purchase = ₱32-33M all-in

**Expected return (conservative):**
- Exit Year 3 at ₱130M (land-led sale)
- **Gross return:** 3.9-4.3x on ₱30-33M all-in
- **3-year IRR:** 60-75%

## Appendices

### A. Sensitivity Analysis (Land Value)

| Scenario | Land Value (₱M) | Implied Return | IRR (24mo flip) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Bear case (forced liquidation) | 70 | 2.3x | 53% |
| Base case (zonal value floor) | 81-97 | 2.7-3.2x | 65-80% |
| Bull case (market value) | 113-146 | 3.8-4.9x | 93-123% |

**Takeaway:** Even in bear case (30% below zonal value), you're looking at 2.3x return. Risk-reward is asymmetric.

### B. Permit Transfer Cost Estimates

| Permit | Transfer Cost | Timeline | Risk |
|--------|---------------|----------|------|
| Mayor's Permit | ₱20-50K | 30 days | Low |
| BIR re-registration | ₱10-20K | 14 days | Low |
| TESDA accreditation | ₱50-100K (if re-application) | 90-180 days | Medium |
| Building permits | ₱100-200K (if re-application) | 60-120 days | Medium |
| Environmental (ECC) | ₱300-800K (if new application) | 180-365 days | High |
| **Total (worst case)** | **₱480K-1.17M** | **6-12 months** | |

### C. Comparable Land Sales (Magallanes, Cavite - 2024-2026)

| Property | Size | Price/sqm | Total Price | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Brgy. Aga lot | 2.5 ha | ₱3,800 | ₱95M | Mixed-use zoning, road access |
| Poblacion commercial | 1.8 ha | ₱5,200 | ₱93.6M | Commercial zone, town center |
| Kabulusan farm (adjacent) | 4.1 ha | ₱3,200 | ₱131.2M | Agricultural, similar features |
| **Target property** | **3.3 ha** | **₱900 (ask)** | **₱30M** | **70-83% discount to comps** |

**Conclusion:** Asking price is materially below market. Verify seller motivation + title issues.

**FINAL VERDICT: PROCEED TO DD WITH ₱28M OFFER**

This deal has exceptional risk-adjusted returns driven by land value arbitrage. The operating business is a bonus, not the thesis. Biggest risks are financial opacity and permit transferability, both mitigable through structured DD and deal terms. Recommend moving to LOI submission within 72 hours to test seller's distress level and negotiating posture.
